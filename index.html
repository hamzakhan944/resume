        <h2>Hello.</h2>
        <p>I graduated from COMSATS with a major in Marketing I've always enjoyed marketing and sales, even as far back as high school. I’ve had a chance to put my university knowledge to good by pursuing the passion through free lancing during my free time. I have the know-how of programming languages, prior to current role, I never had experience working on computer languages but I was able to come in and figure out how to move the process forward, just as I could do in sales and marketing role. While I don’t have any real-life work experience. I hope to expand my experience across different industries.</p>
